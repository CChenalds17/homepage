        Hi! My name is Charlie Chen, and I&apos;m currently a sophomore at Harvard concentrating in computer science and electrical engineering. 
        <br /><br />
        I am a project manager in Harvard Tech for Social Good, Education/Politics Chair of our Chinese Students Association, and a trumpet player in the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra.
        I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia and went to high school in center city (Go Birds!). 
        I started playing piano and trumpet from a young age, and I began learning how to code over quarantine. 
        I love cooking all kinds of food (I have a soft spot for tomato egg stir-fry), enjoy making dumb jokes, and can solve a Rubik&apos;s cube in under 20 seconds.
        <br /><br />
        This website, coded from scratch using Next.js and Tailwind, details some of my tech/engineering projects and musical experiments. Enjoy!
